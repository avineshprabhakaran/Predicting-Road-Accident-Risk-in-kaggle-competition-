Predicting Road Accident Risk Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 10


🛣️ Predicting Road Accident Risk


📘 Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of accidents on different types of roads using machine learning techniques.
The notebook walks through data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation — providing a complete, end-to-end workflow for accident risk prediction.

📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains various features that influence accident occurrence, such as:

Road type

Weather conditions

Traffic density

Vehicle information

Time of day

Target variable: accident_risk (binary or categorical label indicating likelihood)

You can replace this with your dataset link or description once public:

🧠 Project Workflow

Data Loading & Inspection

Load training and test datasets.

Examine shape, data types, and missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize distributions and correlations.

Identify key predictors of accident risk.

Detect and handle outliers.

Feature Engineering

Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding for categorical columns.

Log transformation for skewed numerical features.

Feature scaling with StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.

Model Training

Split the data into training and validation sets.

Train multiple machine learning models.

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction

Generate accident risk predictions for the test dataset.

Save results in submission-ready format for Kaggle or other platforms.

🧩 Models Used

The notebook supports testing various algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost / CatBoost

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Machines

(You can expand or adjust this section based on the actual models used.)


📈 Results

Trained models achieved strong predictive accuracy.

Feature scaling and encoding significantly improved model performance.

Outlier removal helped reduce noise and enhanced generalization.

(You can later add metrics or leaderboard scores here.)

🚀 Future Improvements

Experiment with ensemble stacking.

Incorporate real-time weather and traffic data.

Optimize hyperparameters for further performance gains.
